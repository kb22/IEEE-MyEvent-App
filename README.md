# IEEE MyEvent App (Android Application)

The Android application aims to create a unified platform where any IEEE Member can view upcoming events and create events which others can view in their application. The application uses a backend server based on PHP.

## Running the Android App

1. Download the APK __Release1.0.2.apk__
2. Transfer the application to your Android device
3. Open the file explorer in your Android device, and navigate to where you placed the APK
4. Run the APK
5. If it asks for permission, grant the permission to install it
6. Once installed, run the application

## Running the Backend server (Local)

1. Setup a PHP Server (Check ![XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html))
2. Create a folder by the name `MyEventApp` inside the server directory (For XAMPP, inside `htdocs`)
3. Place all the PHP files from this project inside this folder
4. Start the server
> You will have to modify the Android application and replace all the links from the online server to localhost and run the Android app and server on same network.

**NOTE:** The app has been developed as a project for the IEEE madC Competition.
