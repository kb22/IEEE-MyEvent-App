This is a release for the IEEE madC contest. 

Few Points to note:
1. As this is a release for the contest only, the app works by creating a hotspot from the device
and connecting the computer to that internet connection, thus making the laptop as server.
2. The computer should have wamp installed with all the php files in the www folder as listed in the file repository.
3. Change the IP address with the IP address of the hotspot and you are good to go.

The app is fully functional with features as:
1. Log In wih an already existing account.
2. Sign up if the user is new.
3. Get the list of all the IEEE Events taking place all across India.
4. Selecting an event takes the user to the full details of that event.
5. The user stays logged in till he/she does not sign out.
6. The user can create an event.
